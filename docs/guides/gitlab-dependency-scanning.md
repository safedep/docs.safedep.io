## Configure GitLab Dependency Scanning

To enable `vet` dependency scanning in your GitLab project, you need to:

### 1. Enable `CI` on your project.

To do this, create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root of your project.

```bash
touch .gitlab-ci.yml
```

### 2. Add `vet` as a `CI Component` in your ci pipeline.

To do this, add the following to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
include:
  - component: gitlab.com/safedep/ci-components/vet/scan@v1.4.0
```

Now commit and push changes to your project to trigger the first scan.

**This is it! üöÄ, congrulation you have enabled `vet` dependency scanning in your GitLab project.**

You will see the `vet` job in your pipeline, with a `security` tab.

You can find all the vulnerabilities and malware found by `vet` in the `security` tab.

## Inputs & Configuration

This CI Component supports many inputs and configuration options.

All inputs & configuration options are available in the [`vet`'s GitLab Component Catalog](https://gitlab.com/explore/catalog/safedep/ci-components/vet).

### Cloud Sync

To enable [cloud sync](https://docs.safedep.io/cloud/quickstart#vet-with-safedep-cloud) you need to set the following input:

```yml
include:
  - component: gitlab.com/safedep/ci-components/vet/scan@v1.4.0
    inputs:
      cloud: true
      cloud-key: $CLOUD_KEY
      cloud-tenant: $CLOUD_TENANT
```

:::warning

Make sure to put the `CLOUD_KEY` and `CLOUD_TENANT` in the GitLab CI/CD variables.

:::

This will sync the scan results to [SafeDep Cloud](https://docs.safedep.io/cloud).
